Robot Framework visual identity
===============================

This repository contains guidelines and assets related to Robot
Framework's new visual identity. The new identity was already used at
`RoboCon 2018 <http://robocon.io>`_ and it will also be taken into use
at http://robotframework.org soon. `Robot Framework shop
<http://shop.robotframework.org>`_ also has gear using the new design.

Logo

Robot Framework logo is available in various formats:

- `PNG <logo/robot-framework.png>`_ for web
- `White PNG <logo/robot-framework-white.png>`_ also for web
- `PDF with CMYK <logo/robot-framework-cmyk.pdf>`_ for print
- `PDF with RGB <logo/robot-framework-rgb.pdf>`_ for digital display

Brand guidelines
